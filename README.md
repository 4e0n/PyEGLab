# PyEGLab
"Python Encephalography Laboratory" is an EEGLAB work-alike for analysis of EEG and possibly some other electrophysiological data, yet completely written in Python/C++,  thus not depending anyway on proprietary software.

-- the first things I'm writing during the following weeks is a EEG (trace) class, and a TRC importer (Micromed), a SAM32 is what I only have currently at hand.
